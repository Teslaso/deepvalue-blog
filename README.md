# Deep Value Research

Astro static research site for published investment research, AI and technology notes, research logs, and essays beyond the core research domains.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run studio        # local Web writing studio (loopback only)
npm run studio:test   # studio test suite
```

## Publish from Obsidian

The Obsidian Vault and this repository stay completely separate. The Vault is
treated as read-only: publication scans only Markdown with the YAML boolean
`publish: true`, copies supported images, builds an isolated preview, and changes
the repository only after explicit confirmation.

One-time setup:

```bash
cp publish.config.example.json publish.config.local.json
# Edit vaultRoot and attachmentRoots; this local file is Git-ignored.
```

Publish the active note (the path must be absolute):

```bash
npm run publish:current -- --source "/absolute/path/to/Vault/note.md"
```

Review all eligible new or changed notes:

```bash
npm run publish:pending
```

Both commands normally open a localhost confirmation page. Choose **Confirm &
Push**, **Confirm without Push**, or **Cancel**. For intentional automation, use
`--yes --no-push`; without `--yes`, publication cannot apply non-interactively.
See [publisher/README.md](publisher/README.md) for frontmatter, recovery, privacy,
and Obsidian shell-command setup.

## Writing Studio (local Web editor)

`npm run studio` opens a loopback-only Web editor that reads and writes the
Markdown notes directly inside the configured Vault publishing directories. It
offers an immediate blog-style preview, frontmatter form, image paste/drop, and
reuses the exact two-stage Publisher transaction above for the final
"准备发布 → 确认并推送" flow.

```bash
npm run studio            # opens the browser
npm run studio -- --no-open
```

The server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, authenticates every API call with a
per-session token, and never scans or exposes the rest of the Vault. Configure
`studioWorkspaces` and `studioAttachmentRoot` in `publish.config.local.json`
(see [publisher/README.md](publisher/README.md)). The CLI publisher remains
fully supported and unchanged.

## Content

Published articles and research logs live in:

```text
src/content/entries/
```

Each entry is a Markdown file with structured frontmatter. This is the minimal published article:

```yaml
---
title: 文章标题
publish_id: stable-public-slug
domain: investment
section: commodities
topic: copper
format: article
status: published
published_at: 2026-07-21
summary: 列表与 SEO 摘要
source_type: original
tags: [铜]
commodities: [铜]
companies: []
tickers: []
---
```

Only `status: published` entries appear in lists or receive `/blog/<publish_id>/` routes. Draft and archived entries remain in the content collection but are not public.

The public taxonomy is deliberately two-dimensional:

- `domain`: `investment`, `ai`, or `beyond` (what the note is about)
- `format`: `article` or `log` (whether it is a finished argument or a dated research record)

Books, podcasts, reports, news, and original work belong in `source_type`; they
are sources rather than navigation categories.

## Routes

```text
/investment/    投资研究
/ai/            AI 与技术
/research-log/  研究日志
/beyond/        边界之外
/archive/       全部已发布内容
/about/         关于 Deep Value
/blog/<id>/     文章或日志详情
```

The six legacy topic URLs are HTTP 301 redirects managed in `vercel.json`. Their
`section` and `topic` query parameters filter the destination list in the browser.

## Release verification

Run the full suite before publishing:

```bash
npm run studio:test
npm run publish:test
npm test
npm run build
test -f 'dist/blog/滨化股份-g5-级电子级氢氟酸真业务小体量与第二曲线验证/index.html'
test ! -e 'dist/blog/ai数据中心研究占位'
test ! -e 'dist/blog/氟化工研究占位'
test ! -e 'dist/blog/能源研究占位'
for route in investment ai beyond research-log archive about; do test -f "dist/$route/index.html"; done
git diff --check
```

## Architecture

- Astro content collections validate entry metadata.
- Markdown files are the source of truth.
- Pages are statically generated for fast deployment and simple hosting.
